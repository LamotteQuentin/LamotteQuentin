# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

Greetings to you, fellow visitor.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm mostly developping stuff using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a backend for servers or apps.

Most projects made public on my GitHub are apps developed with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) since I like building various desktop tools.

I also recently moved from [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) to [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) for my [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) UIs.
Thus, I'd consider my favortie stack as **Electron+Vue** which allows for creating powerfull Node.js-based desktop softwares!

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm trying to improve my skills in cloud-based systems for topics like:
- CI & CD
- Service hosting
- Task automation
- API services
- AI computing
